### Welcome to Chunlin's homepage!

Chunlin Song is currently a special research associate at the [Institute of Mountain Hazards and Environment](http://english.imde.cas.cn/){:target="_blank"}, [Chinese Academy of Sciences](http://english.cas.cn/){:target="_blank"} working on the aquatic carbon cycling in cryosphere ecosystems. He studied hydrology and water resources engineering at [Sichuan University](http://en.scu.edu.cn/){:target="_blank"} from 2009 to 2013. He received a doctorate in physical geography from the Institute of Mountain Hazards and Environment, Chinese Academy of Sciences and the [University of Chinese Academy of Sciences](http://english.ucas.ac.cn/) in 2019. He was a visiting PhD student at [School of Forestry and Environmental Studies, Yale University](https://environment.yale.edu/){:target="_blank"} from November 2017 to January 2019. His doctoral work was mainly about riverine carbon cycling and hydrological processes of the [Qinghai-Tibet Plateau](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tibetan_Plateau){:target="_blank"} rivers and streams, especially for [Yangtze River](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yangtze){:target="_blank"} headwaters. His research interests include riverine carbon cycle, inland water biogeochemistry, ecohydrology, permafrost carbon-climate feedbacks, permafrost hydrology and hydro-environment etc. See more details in his [**Curriculum Vitae**](https://songchunlin.net/files/others/songchunlin_cv.pdf){:target="_blank"}.
