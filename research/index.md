## Biogeochemistry of Inland Waters in the Cryosphere Region

Cryospheric inland waters are critical pipes and reactors in the carbon and nutrient cycles. Climate change and cryosphere degradation pose widespread and substantial impacts on the aquatic biogeochemical cycles in the cryosphere region. Our lab delves into the patterns, processes, mechanisms, and impacts of carbon and other nutrient cycles in cryospheric rivers, streams, ponds, and lakes. We are particularly interested in the transport and transformation of carbon in aquatic ecosystems under the influence of climate change in permafrost regions, as well as greenhouse gas budgets of cryospheric inland waters. We seek to understand how the terrestrial process change disturbs the aquatic biogeochemical cycles and how the aquatic carbon budget affects the watershed carbon budget. We also study the processes and controls of aquatic metabolism in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau aquatic ecosystems.
 
## Cold Region Hydrology (Cryohydrology)

Climate change and the degradation of the cryosphere are exerting profound influences on hydrological processes, particularly in high-altitude and cold-region environments. This research seeks to understand the impacts and underlying mechanisms of permafrost changes on cryohydrological dynamics. Specifically, we investigate how permafrost thaw and active layer freeze-thaw processes alter the surface and subsurface water pathways and seasonal runoff patterns in cold-region watersheds. We also study the sediment transport and deposition processes in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau rivers. The changing cryohydrological and sediment processes also affect the biogeochemistry of inland waters in the cryosphere region.
